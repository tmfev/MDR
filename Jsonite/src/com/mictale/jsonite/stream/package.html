<h2>Package Specification</h2>

This is the JSON streaming API. It provides streaming access to JSON content.
The smallest piece of information inside a stream that can be transferred is a
{@link com.mictale.jsonite.stream.Tuple}.
<p>
A JSON stream either implements {@link com.mictale.jsonite.stream.Producer} when
it produces tuples that can be read or {@link com.mictale.jsonite.stream.Consumer}
when it consumes tuples that can be written to the stream.
