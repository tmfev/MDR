<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>
	The Metadata Repository is a browser-based 3-tier application. It is based on an SQL database
	(currently Apache Derby). On top of Derby runs Hibernate as an ORM which implements the domain model. 
	The project is restricted to the JPA implementation of Hibernate. Check the 
	<a href="dependencies.html">list of dependencies</a> for a complete set of all third party libraries.
</p>
<p>
	There is a JSON Restful API for both browser and automation clients available. This API is hosted as a
	servlet that runs commands in the business layer. 
</p>
<p>
	The browser runs a GWT application and features a partial and simplified model of the domain model.  
</p>

<h1>Data Interfaces</h1>
<p>
	The MDR features 2 distinct interfaces to bring data into and out of the server. <a href="mdt.html">Meta Data Templates</a>
	map XML data to the MDR domain model and help you to integrate external data present as XML. The 
	<a href="rest.html">MDR Rest API</a> defines a remote API to fetch content at runtime by making HTTP JSON
	calls.
