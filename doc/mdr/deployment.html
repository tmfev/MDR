<h1>Deployment</h1>

<p>
	To deploy the MDR WAR file, you need to install and configure a servlet container. The MDR successfully ran
	on a Jetty and Tomcat server but any other container that adheres to the servlet specification should be fine.
</p>
<p>
	To deploy the WAR file, you need to follow the deployment instructions of the servlet container. Usually,
	all you need to do is to copy the WAR file to the webapps folder of the servlet container. If you want to
	run the application on the root path of the server, additional configuration steps will be necessary.
</p>

<h2>Home Folder</h2>
<p>
	The MDR application owns a specific folder on the file system of the server that hosts the servlet engine.
	This folder contains the database files, database backup files and the user authentications. 
</p>
<p>
	If you want the folder to reside on a different machine, you'll need to mount the drive onto the server machine
	and access it using a local path.
</p>
<p>
	To determine the name of the folder, the application does the following:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>First, it looks up path in the JNDI context <code>java:comp/env</code> named <code>MDR</code>. The object is
	expected to be a string which is the absolute folder name.</li>
	<li>If there is no such JNDI object, the application will lookup a system environment variable called <code>MDR</code>.
	Again, the value is the absolute path of the folder.</li>
	<li>If there is no such environment variable, and as a last resort, the application appends <code>/mdr</code> to the home 
	directory of the current user and uses this folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	After evaluating the absolute path, the application performs the following validations:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The application checks of the specified folder exists. If the folder does not exist, the application will fail to start.</li>
	<li>The application checks if it has write permissions on the folder. If the application does not have write permissions, it will fail to start.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Users</h2>
<p>
	User administration uses a simple htdigest file that stores the hashed passwords. You can use <code>users.htdigest.default</code>
	as a template. Store the file (renamed to <code>users.htdigest</code> in the home folder of the application.
