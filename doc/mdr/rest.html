<h1>MDR Rest API</h1>

<p>
	Using the Client Service API, remote clients can make HTTP calls to a supporting 
	MDR server and fetch information in a structured way.
	A client can make calls to the Client API to request information from an MDR server. Calls must 
	comply with the HTTP/1.1 Protocol (See http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html).
</p>

<h2>Requests</h2>
<p>
	The request uses the HTTP method GET. The request must contain an Accept header field to 
	indicate that is accepts the content type "application/json". It is recommended that clients 
	do not specify additional content types as the server may favor HTML over JSON in 
	future releases.
<p></p>
	A client fetches the contents of an entity by making a GET request for the entity. The URL of the 
	entity is /mdr/items/&gt;urn-specification> where &gt;urn-specification> is the URN 
	of the entity.
<p></p>		
	A client fetches the contents of a relation by making a GET request for the entity relation. The URL 
	of an entity relation is the concatenation of an entity URL and the name of the relation.
	
<h3>Queries</h3>
<p>
	Queries run well known database queries and return the result elements.
<p></p>	
	With queries, a client can request a set of entities that match certain criteria. A client can also 
	specify additional parameters for the query.
<p></p>	
	The URL of a query call is /mdr/queries/&gt;name> where &gt;name> is the name of the query. The name of the query
	is the name of a named query defined in the <code>net.xclinical.iso11179</code> package, e.g. <code>Item.searchByRating</code> 
	Additional parameters can be added as query parameters to the URL. Pass parameters as named URI parameters <code>p0</code>, <code>p1</code>, etc.
</p>

	
<h3>Identified Item</H3>
<p>
	The query for an identified item can retrieve a specific item from the repository when the client 
	knows its scoped identifier. The scoped identifier in turn is defined by a Namespace and an 
	identifier string. A Namespace is uniquely defined by its scheme reference. To make things easier, a 
	caller can specify all parameters in a single query.
<p></p>	
	For example, the singleton root context of any MDR can be retrieved using the following query:
	/mdr/queries/identifiedItem?namespace=urn:mdr:data&identifier=root
</p>

<h3>Full Text Search</h3>
<p>
	This API call is an equivalent to the search feature in the MDR user interface. Full text search 
	indexes specific properties of every entity and maintains a relationship between the entity that is 
	being indexed and a related entity that is the target of the index entry. A query then returns the 
	target entity and not the entity being indexed. For example, when search adds a Designation to the 
	index, the target will be the DesignatableItem that contains this Designation.
	The URL for the search call is /mdr/queries/search?q=<search term>. On success, the 
	caller receives a list of entities that match the search criteria.
</p>

<h2>Responses</h2>
<p>
	For every request, the server sends an HTTP response. The response either contains the requested 
	data or an error message. If the HTTP result code is 200, the request has been processed 
	successfully and the response is the JSON encoded entity or relation. (See http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt)
	The response is always UTF-8 encoded.
<p></p>	
	If the requested data was an entity GET, then the response is a JSON object that contains the 
	entity. If the requested data was a relation, the response is a JSON array that contains the members 
	of the relation.
</p>

<h1>JSON Mapping</h1>
<p>
	In many technologies, there exists a direct mapping from a JSON object to a runtime object. E.g. in 
	JavaScript, eval() creates such an object. Since the names of the attributes will be named as the are 
	specified in JSON, the server returns "JSON-friendly" names instead of the original ISO11179 
	names.
<p></p>	 
	As a general rule, type names will begin with a capital letter and will be camel cased with no 
	underscores. To build a type name from its ISO11179 equivalent, remove the underscores. E.g. 
	Value_Domain becomes ValueDomain. Property names begin with a lower case character followed 
	by camel case. To build a property name from its ISO11179 equivalent, remove the underscores 
	and capitalize the character following the underscore.
</p>
	
<h3>Display Names</h3>
<p>
	The server adds an additional property called displayName to all entities. The display name is 
	intended to be used to label the entity.
</p>

<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>
	1:1 relations are represented in JSON as an attribute that has a bare representation of the target 
	entity as its value. A bare representation is defined as a JSON object that only returns the id and 
	displayName attributes. If the target entity is not defined, the value is null.
	1:n relations are represented as JSON arrays. Every element of the array is again a JSON 
	representation of the entity.
</p>
	
<h3>Windowing</h3>
<p>
	Windows is not implemented, yet
<p></p>	
	With windowing, a client can limit the amount of data returned by a 1:n relation request. For every 
	such request, the client must specify the index of the first element and the number of elements to 
	return. The server returns the array of entities and the total size of the array.
	The specification of the window is based on the Content-Range field (See http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html, chapter 14.16).
 	A request contains an additional query parameter range that contains the window specification. For example, the path 
 	/mdr/entities/urn:mdr:Context@2/designations?range=0-99 would return at most 
	the first 100 elements of the relation. 
	The first element of the array returned is the actual range of the data, e.g. 0-99/239.
</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>
<p>
	Authentication in not implemented in the current version of the Client Service API. For GET 
	requests, a possible solution would be that a client deposits a public key on the server that is 
	attached to a specific account. A client would then sign a challenge sent by the server and the 
	server would create an authentication token on success and return it to the client. The client would 
	then add the token as a header field on every call.
</p>
	
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>
	To experiment with the Client Service API, it is recommended to use a command line tool like 
	curl or wget. The following examples have been designed and tested using curl.
	Tip: The MDR user interface shows the object id for every entity. You can use these ids to construct 
	your test URLs.
</p>

<h2>Example 1</h2>
<p>
	Purpose: Fetch a single context (this is the root context).
	http://localhost:8888/mdr/entities/urn:mdr:Context@2
<pre>
{
 "id": "urn:mdr:Context@2"
}
</pre>

<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>
	Purpose: Fetch a list of designations (This entity has one single designation).
	http://localhost:8888/mdr/entities/urn:mdr:Context@2/designations
<pre>
[
 {
 "id": "urn:mdr:Designation@1",
 "displayName": "MDR",
 "sign": "MDR",
 "language": "urn:mdr:LanguageIdentification@1",
 "item": "urn:mdr:Context@2"
 }
]
</pre>

<h2>Example 3</h2>
<p>
	Purpose: Query a set of items by name, ordered by rating.
	http://localhost:8888/mdr/queries/Item.searchByRating?p0=TAG%25
</p>
<p>
	Note 1: %25 is the escaped % character to perform a wildcard search.
</p> 
<p>
	Note 2: The search index stores terms in uppercase.
