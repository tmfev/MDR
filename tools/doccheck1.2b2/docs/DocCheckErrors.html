  errors can be fixed first.</p>

        <td>Inner class, inner interface, field, constructor, or method missing 
          a comment. (When the required comment is so obvious that it can be automatically 
          generated from the name of the method, as for example, <code>getComponentColor()</code>, 
          the severity level can be reduced using the <code>-evident</code> switch.)</td>

      <tr> 
        <td valign="TOP"><b>Severity 3</b></td>
        <td> 
          <p>Tag errors caused by missing, incomplete, or extraneous tags. Produces 
            tag templates suitable for cutting and pasting. For example:</p>
          <pre>    * @param foo an int specifying the ... value</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td valign="TOP"><b>Severity 4</b></td>
        <td> 
          <p>Text errors and link errors. Text errors are caused by unterminated 
            HTML tags or a missing period in the first sentence of a comment, 
            or by unterminated HTML tags anywhere in the body of the comment. 
            Link errors are caused by missing @see links.</p>
          <p> <b>Note:</b> The body of the comment is only checked if the first 
            sentence was ok. The reason: if the first sentence contains something 
            like &quot;This method does: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;one thing.&quot; 
            Then this &quot;first sentence&quot; will contain unterminated html 
            (ul and li). To check the &quot;body&quot; would now produce spurious 
            errors. But to check the whole comment would duplicate real errors 
            in the first sentence (for example, an unclosed bold tag). So DocCheck 
            punts. Moral: Run DocCheck multiple times, until no errors occur. 
            Then you know your API comments are clean.</p>

          <code>// Inherited {&lt;from&gt;}</code> is included in the code. Can 
          also be the level assigned to &quot;self-evident&quot; comments using

  <a name="unable"></a>Errors DocCheck Can't Find</h2>
<p>This table lists errors that DocCheck is currently unable to report, either 
  because they are intercepted by JavaDoc before the DocCheck doclet has a chance 
  to see them, or because some other API extension is required to make them visible. 
  When the JavaDoc API is extended so the doclet can access the errors, the contents 
  of this list will move down to the <a href="#current">Errors Generated by DocCheck</a> 
  section. The error level shown in the left column is the one that is anticipated 
  for that error.</p>

      added to set the error level to use when they are missing a comment. Default=2)

      On the one hand, the extreme redundancy of the comment renders it meaningless, 
      because no additional information is provided. On the other hand, when DocCheck 
      generates a comment template, this is exactly the kind of text it produces! 
      In general, there is a tradeoff between requiring comments to be present 
      on all methods, and requiring the comments to say something interesting. 
      (Sometimes, there simply isn't anything useful to say!) The <code>-evident</code> 
      command line switch was added for that reason, so that missing comments 
      which are &quot;self-evident&quot;could be downgraded to a lower error level.</td>
