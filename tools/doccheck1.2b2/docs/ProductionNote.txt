The "master" directory for the doccheck package is
at /home/ericarms/dev/doccheck.

I work on them there and then publish them:
  /java/jdk/ws/tools/doclets/doccheck         (source, classes, docs)
  /usr/web/work/products/jdk/javadoc/doccheck (docs only)

Here's the calling hierarchy for the build scripts:

  makeAll 
    compileAll
      compileIf
         compile
    makeApiDocs
    makeZipFile

This one is used if any changes affected the sample output,
causing them to be copied. (That happens in my home directory.
The result is published to /java/jdk/... and /usr/web/...)
  makeAndFixSample
    fixSampleDocsAt
       fixSampleDoc

For a heartbeat test, use
  % cd test
  % runtest

This test processes contents of test/testsrc, creating
test/testout
