  The Sun Doc Check Utilities consist of the doc check doclet (DocCheck) and a 
  utility package. DocCheck is an extension to the Javadoc tool that reviews Javadoc 
  comments in the source code, identifying gaps and irregularities. It produces 
  an HTML report that separates serious problems from trivial ones, and makes 
  &quot;suggestions&quot; in the form of templates that show you what is needed. 
  (Those suggestions can then be copied into the code and edited.) DocCheck recursively 
  examines directories, and can be instructed to ignore packages and classes using 
  fully-qualified wildcard patterns. The utility package contains a tool that 
  scans a directory tree to generate a list of packages, as well as pattern-matching 
  classes for filenames. 
<blockquote>
  <blockquote> <b>Support Note</b> - DocCheck is <b>experimental</b> code developed 
    for internal use at Sun and released to the developer community for use as-is. 
    It is not a supported product. Use at your own risk. While we have worked 
    to make it useful, bugs might not be fixed and features might not be added. 
    It might not be updated, and might be re-released with a different implementation 
    or GUI design that is incompatible with the current design. </blockquote>
