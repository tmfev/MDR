/**
 * A runtime Cache Exception.
 * <p/>
 * These exceptions may be handled by a <code>CacheExceptionHandler</code> registered with a Cache.
 * The handler provides a key if it is available. A convention that should be followed in exception messages is
 * to include in the message "key keyValue" e.g. "key 1234" so that keys can be parsed out of exception messages. 
 * <p/>
 * Updated in version 1.5 to remove <code>getInitialCause</code> which was a left over from the pre-JDK1.4
 * days. It breaks JAXB.
