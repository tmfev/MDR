/**
 * An interface for Ehcache.
 * <p/>
 * Ehcache is the central interface. Caches have {@link Element}s and are managed
 * by the {@link CacheManager}. The Cache performs logical actions. It delegates physical
 * implementations to its {@link net.sf.ehcache.store.Store}s.
 * <p/>
 * A reference to an EhCache can be obtained through the {@link CacheManager}. An Ehcache thus obtained
 * is guaranteed to have status {@link Status#STATUS_ALIVE}. This status is checked for any method which
 * throws {@link IllegalStateException} and the same thrown if it is not alive. This would normally
 * happen if a call is made after {@link CacheManager#shutdown} is invoked.
 * <p/>
 * Statistics on cache usage are collected and made available through public methods.
