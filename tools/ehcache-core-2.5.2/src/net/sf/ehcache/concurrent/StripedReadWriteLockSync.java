 * The more stripes, the higher the concurrency. To be threadsafe, the instance of CacheLockProvider needs to be
 * maintained for the entire life of the cache or store, so there is some added memory use.

 * Though a new class, this code has been refactored from <code>BlockingCache</code>, where it has been in use
 * in highly concurrent production environments for years.
