 * @author Doug Lea
 * Main interface for locks, gates, and conditions.
 * <p/>
 * Sync objects isolate waiting and notification for particular
 * logical states, resource availability, events, and the like that are
 * shared across multiple threads. Use of Syncs sometimes
 * (but by no means always) adds flexibility and efficiency
 * compared to the use of plain java monitor methods
 * and locking, and are sometimes (but by no means always)
 * simpler to program with.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Most Syncs are intended to be used primarily (although
 * not exclusively) in  before/after constructions such as:
 * <pre>
 * class X {
 *   Sync gate;
 *   // ...
 * <p/>
 *   public void m() {
 *     try {
 *       gate.acquire();  // block until condition holds
 *       try {
 *         // ... method body
 *       }
 *       finally {
 *         gate.release()
 *       }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) {
 *       // ... evasive action
 *     }
 *   }
 * <p/>
 *   public void m2(Sync cond) { // use supplied condition
 *     try {
 *       if (cond.attempt(10)) {         // try the condition for 10 ms
 *         try {
 *           // ... method body
 *         }
 *         finally {
 *           cond.release()
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) {
 *       // ... evasive action
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Syncs may be used in somewhat tedious but more flexible replacements
 * for built-in Java synchronized blocks. For example:
 * <pre>
 * class HandSynched {
 *   private double state_ = 0.0;
 *   private final Sync lock;  // use lock type supplied in constructor
 *   public HandSynched(Sync l) { lock = l; }
 * <p/>
 *   public void changeState(double d) {
 *     try {
 *       lock.acquire();
 *       try     { state_ = updateFunction(d); }
 *       finally { lock.release(); }
 *     }
 *     catch(InterruptedException ex) { }
 *   }
 * <p/>
 *   public double getState() {
 *     double d = 0.0;
 *     try {
 *       lock.acquire();
 *       try     { d = accessFunction(state_); }
 *       finally { lock.release(); }
 *     }
 *     catch(InterruptedException ex){}
 *     return d;
 *   }
 *   private double updateFunction(double d) { ... }
 *   private double accessFunction(double d) { ... }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * If you have a lot of such methods, and they take a common
 * form, you can standardize this using wrappers. Some of these
 * wrappers are standardized in LockedExecutor, but you can make others.
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 * class HandSynchedV2 {
 *   private double state_ = 0.0;
 *   private final Sync lock;  // use lock type supplied in constructor
 *   public HandSynchedV2(Sync l) { lock = l; }
 * <p/>
 *   protected void runSafely(Runnable r) {
 *     try {
 *       lock.acquire();
 *       try { r.run(); }
 *       finally { lock.release(); }
 *     }
 *     catch (InterruptedException ex) { // propagate without throwing
 *       Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 *     }
 *   }
 * <p/>
 *   public void changeState(double d) {
 *     runSafely(new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() { state_ = updateFunction(d); }
 *     });
 *   }
 *   // ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * One reason to bother with such constructions is to use deadlock-
 * avoiding back-offs when dealing with locks involving multiple objects.
 * For example, here is a Cell class that uses attempt to back-off
 * and retry if two Cells are trying to swap values with each other
 * at the same time.
 * <pre>
 * class Cell {
 *   long value;
 *   Sync lock = ... // some sync implementation class
 *   void swapValue(Cell other) {
 *     for (;;) {
 *       try {
 *         lock.acquire();
 *         try {
 *           if (other.lock.attempt(100)) {
 *             try {
 *               long t = value;
 *               value = other.value;
 *               other.value = t;
 *               return;
 *             }
 *             finally { other.lock.release(); }
 *           }
 *         }
 *         finally { lock.release(); }
 *       }
 *       catch (InterruptedException ex) { return; }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Here is an even fancier version, that uses lock re-ordering
 * upon conflict:
 * <pre>
 * class Cell {
 *   long value;
 *   Sync lock = ...;
 *   private static boolean trySwap(Cell a, Cell b) {
 *     a.lock.acquire();
 *     try {
 *       if (!b.lock.attempt(0))
 *         return false;
 *       try {
 *         long t = a.value;
 *         a.value = b.value;
 *         b.value = t;
 *         return true;
 *       }
 *       finally { other.lock.release(); }
 *     }
 *     finally { lock.release(); }
 *     return false;
 *   }
 * <p/>
 *  void swapValue(Cell other) {
 *    try {
 *      while (!trySwap(this, other) &&
 *            !tryswap(other, this))
 *        Thread.sleep(1);
 *    }
 *    catch (InterruptedException ex) { return; }
 *  }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Interruptions are in general handled as early as possible.
 * Normally, InterruptionExceptions are thrown
 * in acquire and attempt(msec) if interruption
 * is detected upon entry to the method, as well as in any
 * later context surrounding waits.
 * However, interruption status is ignored in release();
 * <p/>
 * Timed versions of attempt report failure via return value.
 * If so desired, you can transform such constructions to use exception
 * throws via
 * <pre>
 *   if (!c.attempt(timeval)) throw new TimeoutException(timeval);
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * The TimoutSync wrapper class can be used to automate such usages.
 * <p/>
 * All time values are expressed in milliseconds as longs, which have a maximum
 * value of Long.MAX_VALUE, or almost 300,000 centuries. It is not
 * known whether JVMs actually deal correctly with such extreme values.
 * For convenience, some useful time values are defined as static constants.
 * <p/>
 * All implementations of the three Sync methods guarantee to
 * somehow employ Java <code>synchronized</code> methods or blocks,
 * and so entail the memory operations described in JLS
 * chapter 17 which ensure that variables are loaded and flushed
 * within before/after constructions.
 * <p/>
 * Syncs may also be used in spinlock constructions. Although
 * it is normally best to just use acquire(), various forms
 * of busy waits can be implemented. For a simple example
 * (but one that would probably never be preferable to using acquire()):
 * <pre>
 * class X {
 *   Sync lock = ...
 *   void spinUntilAcquired() throws InterruptedException {
 *     // Two phase.
 *     // First spin without pausing.
 *     int purespins = 10;
 *     for (int i = 0; i < purespins; ++i) {
 *       if (lock.attempt(0))
 *         return true;
 *     }
 *     // Second phase - use timed waits
 *     long waitTime = 1; // 1 millisecond
 *     for (;;) {
 *       if (lock.attempt(waitTime))
 *         return true;
 *       else
 *         waitTime = waitTime * 3 / 2 + 1; // increase 50%
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * In addition pure synchronization control, Syncs
 * may be useful in any context requiring before/after methods.
 * For example, you can use an ObservableSync
 * (perhaps as part of a LayeredSync) in order to obtain callbacks
 * before and after each method invocation for a given class.
