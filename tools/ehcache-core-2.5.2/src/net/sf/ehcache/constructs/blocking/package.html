    Doug Lea in his book Concurrent Programming in Java talks about concurrency support constructs.
    One meaning of a construct is "an abstract or general idea inferred or derived from specific instances".
    Just like patterns emerge from noting the similarities of problems and gradually finding a solution to
    classes of them, so to constructs are general solutions to commond problems. With the constructs package,
    concrete, extensible implementations are offered to solve these common problems.
