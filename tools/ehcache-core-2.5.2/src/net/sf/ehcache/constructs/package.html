  The constructs package builds on top of the core ehcache classes to create
  implementations for common caching patterns. <br>
  <br>
  All implementations use ehcache as the backing cache. They also share a
  common purpose - to create very high performance Java applications.<br>
  <br>
  <h2>Pattern Implementations</h2>
  <h4>General Purpose Caching </h4>
  <ul>
  <li>BlockingCache
  - a cache which blocks subsequent threads until the
  first read thread populates a cache entry </li>
  <li>SelfPopulatingCache</li>
  - a read-through cache. A cache that
  populates elements as they are requested without requiring the caller
  to know how the entries are populated. It also enables refreshes of
  cache entries without blocking reads on the same entries.</li>
  <li>UpdatingSelfPopulatingCache - a read-through cache. A cache that
  populates elements as they are requested without requiring the caller
  to know how the entries are populated. The cache entry is automatically
  updated on subsequent reads.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Web Caching</h4>
  Servlet 2.3 caching filters that cache HTTP/S responses:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>CachingFilter - an abstract, extensible caching filter.<br>
  </li>
  <li>SimplePageCachingFilter - a concrete implementation which caches
  pages based on the request URI and Query String.<br>
  </li>
  <li>SimplePageFragmentCachingFilter - a concrete implementation which
  caches page fragments based on the request URI and Query String. </li>
  </ul>
