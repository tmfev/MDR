/**
 * A handler which may be registered with an Ehcache, to handle exceptions on Cache operations.
 * <p/>
 * Handlers may be registered at configuration time in ehcache.xml, using a CacheExceptionHandlerFactory, or
 *  set at runtime (a strategy).
 * <p/>
 * If an exception handler is registered, the default behaviour of throwing the exception will not occur. The handler
 * method <code>onException</code> will be called. Of course, if the handler decides to throw the exception, it will
 * propagate up through the call stack. If the handler does not, it won't.
 * <p/>
 * Some common Exceptions thrown, and which therefore should be considered when implementing this class are listed below:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link IllegalStateException} if the cache is not {@link net.sf.ehcache.Status#STATUS_ALIVE}
 * <li>{@link IllegalArgumentException} if an attempt is made to put a null element into a cache
 * <li>{@link net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RemoteCacheException} if an issue occurs in remote synchronous replication
 * <li>
 * <li>
 * </ul>
