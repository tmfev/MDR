/**
 * This is a general purpose mechanism to allow generic extensions to a Cache.
 * <p/>
 * CacheExtensions are tied into the Cache lifecycle. For that reason this interface has the
 *  lifecycle methods.
 * <p/>
 * CacheExtensions are created using the CacheExtensionFactory which has a
 * <code>createCacheCacheExtension()</code> method which takes as a parameter a Cache and
 * properties. It can thus call back into any public method on Cache, including, of course,
 *  the load methods.
 * <p/>
 * CacheExtensions are suitable for timing services, where you want to create a timer to
 * perform cache operations. The other way of adding Cache behaviour is to decorate a cache.
 * See {@link net.sf.ehcache.constructs.blocking.BlockingCache} for an example of how to do
 * this.
 * <p/>
 * Because a CacheExtension holds a reference to a Cache, the CacheExtension can do things
 * such as registering a CacheEventListener or even a CacheManagerEventListener, all from
 * within a CacheExtension, creating more opportunities for customisation.
