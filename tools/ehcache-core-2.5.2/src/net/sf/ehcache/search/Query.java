 * Creates queries for performing cache searches.

 * Queries are created using our search DSL implemented using Java.

 * A fluent interface provides a compact and yet easy-to-read representation. Fluent interfaces are implemented using method chaining.
 * Static factory methods and imports are a great aid in creating a compact, yet readable DSL.

 * Out API has the following features:
 * <p/>
 * Method Chaining - we return <code>this</code>.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * See http://www.infoq.com/articles/internal-dsls-java for a description of these conventions.
 * <p/>
 * A query can be executed and then modified and re-executed. If {@link #end} is called the query is made immutable.
 * <p/>
 * Both Element keys and attributes of Element can be queried. Attributes must be pre-defined for a cache. They are populated by extraction
 * from an Element's value using an {@link net.sf.ehcache.search.attribute.AttributeExtractor} .
 * <p/>
 * Search results can either be Element keys (the default), values, or the result of an {@link Aggregator} function.
 * <p/>
 * A {@link Query} instance can be used by multiple threads
