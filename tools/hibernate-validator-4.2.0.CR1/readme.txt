
  Hibernate Validator
  ==================================================
  Version: 4.2.0.CR1, 09.06.2011


  What is it?
  -----------

  This is the reference implementation of JSR 303 - Bean Validation. 
  Bean Validation defines a metadata model and API for JavaBean validation. 
  The default metadata source is annotations, with the ability to override and extend 
  the meta-data through the use of XML validation descriptors.

  History
  -------

  Prior to version 4.x Hibernate Validators was based on a different source base which 
  is not based on JSR 303. This code can be accessed via

  Using Hibernate Validator
  -------------------------

  - In case you use the distribution archive from the download site, copy hibernate-validator-<version>.jar together
    with all jar files from lib/required into the classpath of your application. You can switch the slf4j binding
    jars for log4j (log4j-<version>.jar and slf4j-log4j12-<version>.jar) with the slf4j binding files of
    your choice. See http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html
    In case you are using Java 5 you have to also include all the jar files from the lib/jdk5 directory.
    The jar files contain the classes needed for JAXB. If you don't use the xml configuration and XML configuration
    is disabled via Configuration.ignoreXmlConfiguration the jar files from the lib/jdk5 directory don't have to be added.

  or 

  - Add the following to your maven or ivy dependency list:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        <version>4.2.0.CR1</version>
    </dependency>

    Hibernate Validator can be found in the JBoss Maven repository:
    http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/

  hibernate-validator-annotation-processor-<version>.jar is an optional jar which can be integrated with your build
  environment respectively IDE to verify that constraint annotations are correctly used. Refer to the online
  documentation for more information.
